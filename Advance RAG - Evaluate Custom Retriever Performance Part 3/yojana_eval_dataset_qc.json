        "node-0": "MILLETS  \n1\nMILLETS\nYojana (January 2023)\nINTERNATIONAL YEAR OF MILLETS 2023\nIndia\u2019s effort has resulted into United Nation\u2019s declaration \nof year 2023 as International Year of Millets (IYM). India \nis on the way to become the global hub of millet production \nwith more than 80% of Asia\u2019s share of production of \nmillets. India is the world\u2019s largest producer of millets, \naccounting 20% of global production and having average \nyield of 1237 kg/hectare more than global average of 1229 \nkg/hectare. Government of India has declared to celebrate \nthe IYM as a Jan Andolan so that Indian millets, recipes \nand value-added products are accepted globally. The top \nfive state producing millets are Rajasthan, Karnataka, \nMaharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.\nMillet production in India\nAccording to World Food Programme, there are an \nestimated 1.2 billion people who consume millet as part \nof their diet.\nMillet production has been stable over the past few \nyears, with an estimated production of 28 million \nmetric tons in 2020.\nIndia is the largest producer of millet, followed by \nNiger and China.\nThe Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has held \nthat it would raise the awareness about production of \nmillets in its member nations. Once in life-time event of \nCOVID-19, the ill-effects of climate change have led to \nthe challenge of food and nutrition security across world. \nMillets, which are drought proof crop and nutrient rich \ncrop can solve this problem.\nIYM 2023 aims to contribute to the UN 2030 Agenda \nfor Sustainable Development, particularly SDG 2 (Zero \nHunger), SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), SDG 8 \n(Decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (Responsible \nconsumption and production), SDG 13 (Climate action) \nand SDG 15 (Life on land).\nBenefits of Millets:\n\u2022 Support climate-resilient agriculture - Millets are \nhardy species, which can tolerate water stresses, at the \nsame time they can help in carbon sequestering. \n\u2022 Contributes to food security and nutrition - Millets \ncan be grown in water scarce dry regions; they are also \nnutrient rich compared to any other grains. \n\u2022 Millets can be important part of a healthy diet - \nMillets are good sources of minerals, dietary fibre, \nantioxidants and protein. With a low glycaemic index, \nthey are a good option for people with high-blood \nsugar. Millets are also gluten-free and an excellent and \ncost-effective source of iron for iron-deficient diets. As \nwhole grains, each variety of millets provide different \namounts and types of fibre. Dietary fibre has a role in \nregulating bowel function, blood sugar and lipids, and \nsatiation. \n\u2022 Greater \nconsumption \nof \nmillets \ncan \noffer \nopportunities to smallholder farmers to improve \ntheir livelihoods.\n\u2022 Greater trade in millets can improve the diversity of \nthe global food system - This not only improve the \ndecent work and economic growth (SDG 8) but also \nthe sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12) \nin the world.\nAlthough millets were grown and used in Indian \nSubcontinent since ancient times, its use decreased \nsignificantly since green revolution came to India. Many \nancient Indian texts cites cultivation and use of millets, \nmany songs and couplets are written on millets. \nOver the years due to a multitude of factors. Socio-\neconomic dynamics resulting from the hardy nature of the \ncrop, relegated them to be the grain of the poor. In many \n1\n\n\n2 \nMILLETS\nplaces the use of millets is systematically discouraged from \ncultivation; for example, Kodo Kotki Hatao Soyabean Lagao \n(Remove Kodo and Little millets and grow soyabean) was \na famous slogan from 2000s undivided Madhya Pradesh.\nNutrition from millets\nApart from being inexpensive and easier to grow, they \nare a rich source of many vitamins, minerals, and fibre. \no  Niacin, a type of Vitamin B found in millets is useful in \nenergy production, and nerve health and keeps the digestive \ntract healthy.  \no  The magnesium. Zinc, and fibre found in millets make it \nan excellent food for blood sugar regulation, especially for \nPCOD and Diabetes. Folic acid helps with iron assimilation \nand improves skin, health, and fertility.\no  The absence of gluten makes it simple to digest.",
        "node-1": "The cereal \nprimarily contains unsaturated fat, which has a low-fat \ncontent. Given its lower glycemic response or reduced \ncapacity to spike blood levels, it helps diabetics maintain \nblood sugar levels. Millets are one of the most nutrient-\ndense cereals.\nClimate suitable for Millets Cultivation:\nMillets are often grown in tropical and subtropical regions \nat an altitude of 2,100 m. Being a heat-loving plant, 8-10\u00b0 \nC is the required minimum temperature for germination. \nIdeal growth temperature for millets is between 26-29\u00b0 C \nfor optimum production and crop yield. Sandy, loamy, \nand alluvial soils with good drainage are the best types of \nsoil for them.\nNutrient management in organic millet cultivation\nUnlike regular cereals, production of millets does not \nrequire chemical fertilisers. Farmers on an increasing \nscale are using organic fertilisers, green manures, efficient \ncrop cycles, integrated nutrient and pest management \netc. Millet farmers frequently succeed in enhancing \nthe physical and chemical characteristics of the soil for \nsustained productivity by using techniques like: \n1. Using organic material, such as compost, vermi-\ncompost, farm yard manure, and bio-fertilisers, to \npreserve soil organic matter and deliver nutrients. \n2. Using cover crops to recycle soil nutrients and bi-\nologically fix nitrogen from the atmosphere.\n3. Planting green manure legumes in situ or using \ngreen leaf manuring and incorporating them into \nthe soil. \n4. Intercropping or growing multiple crops simulta-\nneously. \n5. Rotation of crops. \n6. Management of crop residues.\nApplication of organic matter to the soil\n\u2022 Manures: although, application of manures is \nbeneficial, for millets applying phosphorus to soil may \nnot fetch optimal result as millets are unable to extract \nphosphorus from manures. Hence excess phosphorus \ncan lead to runoff waste.\n\u2022 Compost: Composting makes the organic material \nlean and nutrient rich. It kills some diseases and weed \nseedlings and it is also easier to handle than bulk \norganic matters.\n\u2022 Cover crop: In organic farming, cover crops can \nbe a sustainable and affordable source of nutrients \nby supplying plants\u2019 needs for micronutrients, \nphosphorus and potassium.\n\u2022 Green manures: green manures like Leguminous \nplants, which make up the majority of green manures \ngrown in fields, are often integrated into the soil once \nthey have grown sufficiently. Sunhemp, dhaincha, \npillipesara, cluster beans, and Sesbania rostrana are the \nmost significant crops for producing green manure\n\u2022 Crop rotation: crop productivity, nutrient availability, \ninsect control, nutrient usage efficiency and soil physical \nqualities can all be improved through crop rotation.\nConsumption habits of millets in North-east\n\u2022 Zan: The millet flour dish is favourite dish in \nArunachal Pradesh\n\u2022 Apong: Apong and Madua Apong are two popular \nbeverages in Arunachal Pradesh, made up of rice.

For this, the Ministry \nof Commerce has made necessary policy amendments.\n\u2022 Most of these startups procure coarse grains directly \nfrom farmers. After processing them, they prepare \nproducts and sell them online and offline.\n\u2022 An Agri startup from Tamil Nadu has launched many \nproducts, including South Indian dishes using millets, \nsuch as dosa, pongal, and rava dosa.\n\u2022 Another startup from Hyderabad has come up with \nmulti-millet noodles.\n\u2022 \nPani poori is a famous street food from India, a \nVijayavada based startup has prepared it using multi-\nmillets.\nOverview of millet processing\nMillets are processed in traditional methods in semi-\narid regions, where they are primarily grown for human \nconsumption. \nTraditional \nmethods \nare \nlaborious, \nmonotonous and manual. Traditional techniques that \nare commonly used include decortication (usually by \npounding followed by winnowing or sometimes sifting), \nmalting, fermentation, roasting, flaking, and pounding. \nThese methods are mostly labor-intensive and give a \npoor-quality product.\nIndian Institute of Millets research (IIMR) is developing \nmodern methods for food processing and value additions \nlike- dehulled millet, semolina or suji, flakes, extruded \nproducts (vermicelli and pasta), biscuits, millet -rich \nmultigrain roti and millet-rich multigrain flour to improve \nthe nutritional quality.\nImportance of processing intervention\nOne of the major reasons of less popularity of millets \nconsumption is lack of their ready-to-use and ready-to-eat \nalternatives. Processing reduces this hindrance, at the same \ntime increasing millets\u2019 self-life and taste. The manual de-\nhusking of millets is the reason for poor quality of millet \nflours, this is being reduced by IIMR\u2019s intervention through \nautomatic, mechanical de-husking process. At IIMR, \nan attempt has been made to create demand for millet \nthrough processing interventions by diversifying its food \nuses; integrating all functions from on-farm production to \nconsumption in a \u2018production to consumption\u2019 value chain.\nProcessing of value-added products from millets\n\u2022 Value addition in food processing has a high degree of \ninterdependence with forward and backward linkages \nand hence can play an important role in accelerating \neconomic development. \n\u2022 Value addition has many consumer benefits such \nas simple, low-cost processing and packaging \ntechnologies which can improve the shelf life and \nstorage quality of food and preserve many of the \nhealth-promoting compounds.\nConclusion: Millets are said to be the forerunner of the \nevergreen revolution and therefore, also can be referred to \nas Miracle Grains and a boon to the region.",
